## Boston-Hoston-Prediction
# Project Overview

In this project, I developed and evaluated a multiple linear regression model aimed at predicting the market value of homes in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. By leveraging key features from the dataset—such as crime rate, proximity to employment centers, and property tax rates—I built a model capable of estimating housing prices with a focus on accuracy and interpretability. This project not only demonstrates my understanding of supervised learning techniques but also showcases my ability to handle real-world data, apply proper preprocessing, and validate model performance. Predictive models like this one can serve as powerful tools for stakeholders in the real estate industry, from agents to analysts, helping them make informed decisions backed by data.
